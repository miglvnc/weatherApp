WeatherApp

My first vanilla JavaScript app. Simply weather app with styled elements. 

Weather app use vanilla JS and API. Simply and easy to use application with a couple of styled components (buttons, labels, backgrounds etc.)
To use application just type city name OR coords in right input. 
After a while app will load main informations like city name, temperature and weather icon.
You can click on the "dropdown" place "more information" to extend list of details - wind speed, coords, humidity, timezone, pressure.
Application use geological navigator and asks user for current location to find city/place and show details.
Footer's links will be updated soon, atm I'm on my way to build LinkedIn profile and my own website. Stay tuned :)

Thanks for testing my app.
As always I'm open for any feedback.
